Install missing packages with tlmgr. The `needed_package.sh` script will print you the required packages.

```bash
$tlmgr install missingpackage.sty
```

If tlmgr can not find the right packages, you can download them manually. 

If you dont know where to find the packages you can also use the `needed_packages.sh` script for debian base systems

You are free to modify this template.
